<h1>Why "DevHopeful" in 2025</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Reasons to Learn to Code, According to Chuck</h2>

<hr />

<h3>REASON 1: It will be FUN</h3>
<p>Have you wanted to learn to code but just haven't begun? Me TOO!  Let's just Do It and enjoy the process! Ignore 
    the news and the AI Doomsdayers.  Let's just have fun learning to code!  I promise you will enjoy it.
</p>

<h3>REASON 2: It WILL be a NEW SKILL</h3>
<p>Even if nobody decides to pay me or you for doing this anymore, it will still be a process of learning a new SKILL
    that you can use to build things.  You can build a website, a game, or even an app.  I know there are some projects
    I've thought of that I, personally, want to be able to build myself.  I may use AI to HELP along the way, but I want
    the satisfaction once I've built these things of knowing that I learned the process and then DID IT! (Yes, those of 
    You who subscribe to my channel @DevHopeful will get to see those projects when the time comes.     
</p>

<h3>REASON 3: Coding is STILL a valuable skill that will
    (hopefully) always be in demand.</h3>

<p>Watch the tutorials about "Vibe Coding" and about VS Code's new "Agent Mode" CLOSELY and you'll see that the people 
    who can really use these new AI tools efficiently, already know a LOT about software engineering and development. I have
    a theory that there will for quite some time to come, remain PEOPLE - educated, experienced, well-practiced engineers
    in supervisory roles over the AI Agents even IF the Agents are the ones physically writing the majority of the code. 
    And here's the thing - you don't get to be an educated, experienced, well-practiced engineer without first learning 
    the foundational concepts and practicing your way up from a junior developer through to a senior developer. We're 
    certainly not at the point yet where we can just simply UPLOAD new skills to our brains! We still only learn by practice,
    repitition, and experience.  So at some point, the companies are going to NEED junior developers again.
